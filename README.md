# ZurOS
ZurOS is a very simple OS that doesn't really do to much so far. ZurOS is a solo project, I started working on it at 25.11.2025.

# How to use ZurOS?
*Note:* this section won't include tutorial on how to install or run ZurOS (to run it with qemu simply copy this repository and run run.sh, it will work on Ubuntu I dunno about other OSes)
## List of commands
- clear - clears the screen
- exit - shutdowns the computer (it works in qemu I dunno what will happen on a real computer)
- help - writes a list of all available commands
- test - writes hello world in colors with ids 0x00-0x0F
- Z - tells a very unfunny polish joke in polish
## Keybinds and inconveniences
*List of custom keybinds:*
- Tab - is used to type 'Z' (ZurOS doesn't support shift)
*List of inconveniences:*
- No test scrolling (you will need to use a lot of clear command because of that)
